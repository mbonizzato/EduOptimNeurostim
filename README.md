## Usage notes

The library is built around main.py and a JSON file containing all the necessary parameters (config folder). 
We built a series of tutorials to help navigate all the available features and design library calls (tutorials folder).
A few utilities for data downloading and result visualization complement this release (scripts folder).

You may want to run our Tutorial 1 first.
